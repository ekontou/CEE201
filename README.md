### Linear Programming Jupyter Notebooks (Spring 2020)
Click the following link to practice with the examples that we have seen in class:[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ekontou/CEE201/master)

The ![LPGraphing](https://github.com/ekontou/CEE201/tree/master/LPGraphing) folder includes a linear programming example with graphical solution.
The ![ReVelle Book Problems](https://github.com/ekontou/CEE201/tree/master/ReVelleBook-Problems%20coded%20in%20Python) folder includes three problems of the ![ReVelle et al.](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Revelle-Civil-and-Environmental-Systems-Engineering-2nd-Edition/PGM14791.html) book solved graphically and by calling an LP solver leveraging PuLP.
Other problems are solved graphically icluding a multi-objective problem in ![this](https://github.com/ekontou/CEE201/tree/master/MultiobjectiveOptimizationProblems) folder and a shoterst path problem solved with an LP solver ![here](https://github.com/ekontou/CEE201/tree/master/ShortestPathProblems).

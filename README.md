# CEE201 - Systems Engineering and Economics
### University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign CEE201 coding examples
### Linear Programming Jupyter Notebooks (Spring 22 & 20)
Click the following link to practice with the examples that we have seen in class:[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ekontou/CEE201/master)

The [LPGraphing](https://github.com/ekontou/CEE201/tree/master/LPGraphing) folder includes a linear programming example with graphical solution.
The [ReVelle Book Problems](https://github.com/ekontou/CEE201/tree/master/ReVelleBook-Problems%20coded%20in%20Python) folder includes three problems of the [ReVelle et al.](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Revelle-Civil-and-Environmental-Systems-Engineering-2nd-Edition/PGM14791.html) book solved graphically and by calling an LP solver leveraging PuLP.
Other problems are solved graphically icluding a multi-objective problem in [this](https://github.com/ekontou/CEE201/tree/master/MultiobjectiveOptimizationProblems) folder and a shoterst path problem solved with an LP solver [here](https://github.com/ekontou/CEE201/tree/master/ShortestPathProblems).Examples of COVID-19 and the solution to the CEE201 Spring 2020 project are also included in the corresponding folders.

Please reach out to Dr. Kontou with any questions. The course syllabus is available [here](http://publish.illinois.edu/kontou/files/2020/02/Syllabus-CEE201-Spring2020-Feb03Update.pdf).

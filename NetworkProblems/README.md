# Network Problems
This repo provides code templates to solve classic transportation problems, like *shortest path, transshipment problems, traveling salesperson problems, and etc.*

**Pulp** and **NetworkX** are two packages used in the project to build the transportation networks and solve transportation problems. 
In each template, concept of each problem is defined and two different methods to solve the problem are proposed.

The basic knowledge of using networkX is obtained by the reference of "Introduction to NetworkX".It provides detailed instruction on how to build the network and how to utilize different functions to analyze typical problems and visualize the network solutions. http://avinashu.com/tutorial/pythontutorial/NetworkXBasics.html
